# Neural net introduction and demo
This is a set of neural network demos intended at first-semester graduate students in the physical sciences. 


## Dependencies
I recommend using a virtualenv (but Conda is cool too). To set up a venv named `sandbox`, run

```
python -m venv sandbox
```

Activate it in bash via 
```
source sandbox/bin/activate
```

To install dependencies once the environment:

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
